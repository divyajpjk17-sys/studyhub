  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    Study Hub was created with a simple vision — to make learning accessible, practical, and genuinely enjoyable.
We noticed that most online courses are either too fast, too theoretical, or lack real-world application.
So we built a platform where learning feels like a journey — structured, guided, and empowering.

At Study Hub, our goal is not just to teach concepts but to help students understand, practice, apply, and grow.
Whether you're building your first website, writing Python scripts, understanding the cloud, or mastering prompts for AI tools — you're never learning alone.

      <p>Study Hub helped me transform from someone who only knew basic computer usage to someone who can build an entire website on my own.
The lessons are easy to understand, and the assignments push you to think like a developer. The team’s responsiveness kept me motivated and confident throughout.</p>
